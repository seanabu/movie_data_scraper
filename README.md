# movie_data_scraper

For a project in  the Metis Data Science course, I analyzed data about movies.
This respository includes:
*The python file of the scraper I built using beautifulsoup
* An ipython notebook that shows some of the cleaning and analysis I did to the data
* A csv file of the data and a short powerpoint summarizing my analysis.  

If you read thorugh the scraper file, you will be able to see where you can make adjustments
to alter the data you are scrapping.
